# Example: how to create a boilerplate in a few clicks

## The gist

This example shows you how to compile awesome JS libraries in one single file using [picnicc](https://picni.cc). 

Since picnic uses HTTP requests to collect and put together files (or "assets", or "plugins", if you like), it's easy to tell the API where our favorite plugins are located so we can put together the ones we need every time we start a new project.


## Customize (HTML form)

We simply get in touch with the [picnicc API](https://picni.cc/api/v1) through a basic HTML form, which lets us pick and compile the assets we need for our new project.

[See the form](http://picnicc.github.io/example.simple-boilerplate/customize.html).

## The good thing is...
Picnic grabs ressources directly from their "native" location, which means that we are always working with the latest release of the plugins we've picked.
